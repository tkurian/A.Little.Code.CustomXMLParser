These packages are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n###1. management\r\nThe management package consists of 1 file. This file is as follows:\r\n\r\n##### UIManager.java\r\nThis file will determine which OS you are running and launch a either a Windows GUI or a linux terminal in order to run the aplication.\r\n\r\n***\r\n### 2. linux\r\nThe linux package consists of 1 file. This file is as follows:\r\n\r\n##### LinuxConsole.java\r\nThis file manages the user interface for the lin.x version.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### 3. windows\r\nThe windows package consists of 8 files. These file is as follows:\r\n\r\n##### WindowsGUI.java\r\nThis file manages the graphical user interface for the Custo.XMLParser.\r\n\r\n##### FeedListListener.java\r\nThis file handles the mouse events for the Feed list from the .indowsGUI.\r\n\r\n##### ItemHtmlDisplay.java\r\nThis file creates a display string for displaying a RSS item to the screen. It also creates a CSS style that can be added to an element being added to a J.ditorPane.\r\n\r\n##### ItemListListener.java\r\nThis file is the listener for the item list\r\n\r\n##### RssFeedListCellRenderer.java\r\nThis file is used for displaying a feed list on .he screen.\r\n\r\n##### RssFeedListModel.java\r\nThis file handles linking data between the RSS feed and the f.edManager.\r\n\r\n##### RssItemListCellRenderer.java\r\nThis file is used for displaying the RSS items on.the JList.\r\n\r\n##### RssItemListModel.java\r\nThis class links channel data to a JList display.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### 4. utilities\r\n\r\n##### FileIO.java\r\nThis file will handle reading in the RSS feed/XML file. It will return back the contents of the xml file within a string.\r\n\r\n##### RssFeed.java\r\nThis file handles loading the XML file into a string and setting the feed name, feed url and icon url. It also consists of getter methods in order for easy retrieval of the feed name, feed url and icon url.\r\n\r\n##### RssFeedManager.java\r\nThis file handles the config file, adding feeds, removing feeds. The config file enables us to pre-load a few XMLs into our XMLParser. This means upon loading, some feeds will pre-exist (without the user having to add them). Hence, this file consists of methods to update the config file.\r\n\r\n##### XMLParser.java\r\nThis file manages parsing the XML file/RSS feed. It will then populate the database. This requires parsing channels, images, items and attributes. \r\n\r\n##### XMLValidation.java\r\nThis file consists of some very basic validation tests. We test to see if the version is 2.0 and we check to ensure that the RSS pattern is correct (ie. no missing tags!)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### 5. database \r\nThe database was designed to hold a list of channels. Each channel would consist of items and images. To facilitate this design, the database package had to consist of 4 different files. These files include the following:\r\n\r\n##### DBase.java\r\nThis file is for handling the databaseList. The databaseList consists of channels. Hence it contains methods to add channels, remove channels, count the number of channels, get a specific channel, get the full list of channels or get a channel based on it's attributes (attribute name & value). \r\n\r\n##### Channel.java\r\nThis file is for handling the channelList. The channel list consists of both images and items. \r\n\r\n##### Item.java\r\nThis file is for creating Item objects that will be stored within the channelList. \r\n\r\n##### Image.java\r\nThis file is for handling any images that need to be added to the channelList.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n### 6. test\r\nThe testpackage consists of 1 file. This file is as follows:\r\n\r\n##### ConsoleTestHarness.java\r\nThis file was used in order to test the methods being created, in order to ensure that they were functioning as intended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n\r\n\r\n[Back](http://tkurian-programming.blogspot.ca/p/custom-xml-parser.html)","tagline":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
